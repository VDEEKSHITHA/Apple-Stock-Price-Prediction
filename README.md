# Apple-Stock-Price-Prediction
 

 üìñ Project Overview  
This project aims to predict Apple Inc.'s Apple stock price using machine learning techniques in R. It leverages historical stock data, applies data preprocessing, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and utilizes regression and classification models to forecast stock price trends. The project provides insights into stock movements and helps investors make informed decisions.  

 üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
- Programming Language: R  
- Libraries: tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, forecast, caret, TTR, quantmod  
- Dataset: Apple stock price data (from Yahoo Finance or other sources)   

 üìä Features & Workflow  

 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Preprocessing  
- Import historical stock price data.  
- Handle missing values and data cleaning.  
- Compute technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD).  

 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualize stock price trends using ggplot2.  
- Analyze price movements, volatility, and seasonality.  

 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Selection & Training  
- Regression models for price prediction (Linear Regression, Random Forest, ARIMA).  
- Classification models to predict stock movement (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees).  
- Model evaluation using RMSE, accuracy, and confusion matrices.  

 4Ô∏è‚É£ Forecasting & Interpretation  
- Predict future stock prices.  
- Interpret model results and assess accuracy.  

 üìå How to Run the Project  
1. Install Dependencies  
   Run the following command in RStudio to install necessary libraries:  
   
2. Execute the Script  
   Open Apple_Stock_Price_Prediction.R in RStudio and run the script step by step.  

3. Analyze the Results  
   - Check visualizations in the results/ folder.  
   - Evaluate model predictions and refine parameters.  

 üîÆ Future Enhancements  
- Integrate deep learning models (LSTMs) for improved predictions.  
- Implement real-time stock price forecasting.  
- Deploy as a web application using Shiny.
